# CasasMarCobo

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 18.2.7. The design objective was to create a fast and user-friendly interface for clients interested in inquiring about one of the two properties offered by the complex. Each inquiry is sent to the client’s email, which receives the details from the form previously filled out by the user.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
